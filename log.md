# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've started a project before joining this initiative. My intention is to build a simple but complete project, including its SDLC.

**Thoughts:** I want to create a full CI/CD lifecycle for this project, using TDD as much as possible. A lot to fail and a lot to learn, and a tremendous challenge for this Covid-19 quarantine.

### Day 0: March 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I got stucked in problems with unit-testing the new Coordinate model. As the execution didn't raise any exception, I thought it should be a problem with testing framework, but finally I discovered that the culprit was a bad implementation with getters and setters causing a stack overflow situtation.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy cause I've discovered several ways to debug and run unit tests. Although I couldn't advance too much in coding, I have learned a lot today.
