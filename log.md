# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've started a project before joining this initiative. My intention is to build a simple but complete project, including its SDLC.

**Thoughts:** I want to create a full CI/CD lifecycle for this project, using TDD as much as possible. A lot to fail and a lot to learn, and a tremendous challenge for this Covid-19 quarantine.
