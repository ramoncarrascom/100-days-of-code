The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [March 22, Sunday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D0 
Last pre-challenge day. I've scaffolded my app and brought some basic classes.

### R1D1
Created Coordinate model. First getters and setters implementation was wrong and causing a stack overflow situation. Resolved.
